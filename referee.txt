We thank the referee for their careful and considered report. We have
attempted to address all their comments. Minor comments were addressed
in the text, and we discuss their major comments in more detail below.

>A) While it is clear that the ”twogrid” set-up has the known problems,
>it is not clear to me whether the specific ”twogrid” set-up that the authors

We have run a small simulation with zero initial displacemet using twogrid to
confirm it is completely stable in the absence of perturbations and added
a note on this to the paper.

We have reworded this section of the paper (and the conclusions), labelling it
as speculative and incorporating the suggestions of the referee.

We have added the z=9 results to figures 1 and 2 and added a plot of $\eta$,
with discussion. The referee is quite correct that it is a spurious growing mode
rather than a transient and we have modified the discussion accordingly.

We have reworded this section: our intention was to contrast with the situation
in, for example, the FIRE zoom simulations. Here adaptive softening is justified
using a hydrodynamic argument based on pressure forces (a Jeans swindle):
this argument is not relevant in our coarser resolution cosmological simulations.

We have added a convergence test using a larger halfglass setup to show explicitly
the scales affected by discreteness error (1% at k ~ 1). The adaptive softening produces
a 2% suppression at (k ~ 0.3).
